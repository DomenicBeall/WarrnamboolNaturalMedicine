                <h3>For more than two decades, Graham Pennington has been practising Bowen therapy, naturopathy and acupuncture in his busy, multi-practitioner clinic in Warrnambool, Australia.

                    As a young naturopathic graduate, he was introduced to the Bowen technique when he took over the running of Ossie Rentsch’s clinic in Hamilton in 1989. This unique opportunity provided an intense exposure to the system of therapeutic bodywork that would become such an important component of his professional life.
                    
                    In addition to his experience in Hamilton, Graham has also received extensive mentoring and invested many hours observing Dr Romney Smeeton DC in his Geelong clinic.
                    
                    He has spent the last twenty-three years practising, teaching, and developing the Bowen technique. In this book he seeks to share his clinical knowledge and experience with the practising Bowen therapist.</h3>
